    "# Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the project includes only the initial component: a handwriting recognition model. We plan to significantly expand the project throughout the month, including text analysis and integration with the Electron framework to create a smooth, user-friendly desktop application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Handwritten documents contain valuable personal and professional information, but they are often difficult to search, archive, or analyze compared to digital text. This project addresses the challenge of digitizing and semantically analyzing handwriting using artificial intelligence. The motivation stems from a desire to bridge the gap between analog and digital workflowsâ€”particularly in academic, legal, and productivity-related contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are developing a desktop application using Electron that allows users to upload handwritten documents (preferably images), extract the text using handwriting-optimized OCR models, and analyze the content semantically. This includes recognizing named entities, extracting keywords, and potentially summarizing handwritten text. Our approach combines modern OCR techniques with NLP models in a modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/zypreaxa/hwrclassification](https://github.com/zypreaxa/hwrclassification)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this project consists of publicly available handwriting samples and user-provided handwritten notes in image format (PNG/JPG). For initial development and testing, we used synthetic handwriting datasets (e.g., IAM Handwriting Database) and custom-written samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grayscale conversion and resizing of input images  \n",
    "- Denoising   \n",
    "- Manual curation of samples with diverse handwriting styles  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Faced\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low-quality scans and unusual handwriting patterns made it difficult to train the model effectively  \n",
    "- Layout inconsistencies (e.g., paragraphs vs. annotations) complicated semantic structure detection  \n",
    "- Limited availability of high-quality labeled handwriting data for evaluation  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model & Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### OCR / Handwriting Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a handwriting recognition model implemented in Keras, which was fine-tuned on handwritten examples to improve accuracy on real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned NLP Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using spaCy with transformer models  \n",
    "- **Summarization** using pretrained transformer models like `bart-large-cnn`  \n",
    "- **Keyword Extraction** via KeyBERT for semantic indexing  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Electron** framework provides the desktop UI and handles file input/output  \n",
    "- AI processing is handled by a local **Python backend** (using FastAPI), which communicates with Electron via REST API  \n",
    "- The architecture is modular, allowing easy substitution of OCR or NLP components as needed  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "As the project is still in its early stages, contributions have not yet been evenly distributed. This section will be updated upon project completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External Sources Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keras 3 model (Handwriting recognition)\n",
    "- Hugging Face models (TrOCR, BART)  \n",
    "- spaCy and KeyBERT for text analysis  \n",
    "\n",
    "### GenAI Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT was used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brainstorming project ideas  \n",
    "- Exploring compatible AI technologies and frontend frameworks  \n",
    "- Reviewing and refining documentation (including spelling and semantic clarity)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recognition model struggles with severely degraded or stylized handwriting  \n",
    "- Semantic analysis depends heavily on OCR accuracy; performance drops significantly when recognition accuracy is below ~50%  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement user-specific handwriting adaptation or fine-tune OCR models on personalized samples  \n",
    "- Add multilingual support for handwriting recognition and analysis  \n",
    "- Enhance the UI/UX with features like real-time annotation, document search, or audio summaries  \n"
